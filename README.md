In this internship, the second task assigned to me was to perform exploratory data analysis on the Zomato Dataset.
The dataset from Kaggle is attached in this repository.
Jupyter Notebook is used to analyze the data in the form of tables, bar charts and pie chart.
The Python libraries used for doing the task are NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. The geopandas library of Python was also used to visualize the data on the world map.<br>
